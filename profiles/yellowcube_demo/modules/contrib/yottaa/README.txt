Yottaa Site Optimizer will speed up your Drupal website automatically. 
Faster sites have lower bounce rate, higher conversion rate, and more sales.

Whether you're already a Yottaa Site Optimizer user or want to try it for the 
first time, you'll enjoy the ease of having a Yottaa control panel right on 
your Drupal admin panel. Plugin users also have access to
special caching features only available through the Yottaa module,
which can improve page speed even 
beyond Yottaa Site Optimizer's standard techniques.
